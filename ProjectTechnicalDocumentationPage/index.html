        <p>The Bluetooth protocol operates at 2.4GHz in the same unlicensed ISM frequency band where RF protocols like ZigBee and WiFi also exist. There is a standardized set of rules and specifications that differentiates it from other protocols.</p>
        <p>You may be wondering, why are you looking up Bluetooth?</p>
        <p>Mostly, for fun! Secondly, because I have a neat project for work in mind. And thirdly, almost all of us use Bluetooth everyday.</p>

        <h2>Masters, Slaves, and Piconets</h2>
        <p>Bluetooth networks (commonly referred to as piconets) use a master/slave model to control when and where devices can send data. In this model, a single master device can be connected to up to seven different slave devices. Any slave device in the piconet can only be connected to a single master.</p>
        <img id="piconet" src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/a/e/a/b/5/5216816c757b7f1f668b4567.png" alt="Bluetooth Piconets - Master Slave Protocol">
        <p>The master coordinates communication throughout the piconet. It can send data to any of its slaves and request data from them as well. Slaves are only allowed to transmit to and receive from their master. They can't talk to other slaves in the piconet.</p>

      <section id="Connection_Process" class="main-section">
        <header>Connection Process</header>
        <p>Creating a Bluetooth connection between two devices is a multi-step process involving three progressive states:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Inquiry</li>
          <p>If two Bluetooth devices know absolutely nothing about each other, one must run an inquiry to try to discover the other. One device sends out the inquiry request, and any device listening for such a request will respond with its address, and possibly its name and other information.</p>
          <li>Paging (Connecting)</li>
          <p>Paging is the process of forming a connection between two Bluetooth devices. Before this connection can be initiated, each device needs to know the address of the other (found in the inquiry process).</p>
          <li>Connection
          <p>After a device has completed the paging process, it enters the connection state. While connected, a device can either be actively participating or it can be put into a low power sleep mode.
</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Active Mode --</span> This is the regular connected mode, where the device is actively transmitting or receiving data.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Sniff Mode --</span> This is a power-saving mode, where the device is less active. It'll sleep and only listen for transmissions at a set interval (e.g. every 100ms).</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Hold Mode --</span> Hold mode is a temporary, power-saving mode where a device sleeps for a defined period and then returns back to active mode when that interval has passed. The master can command a slave device to hold.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Park Mode --</span> Park is the deepest of sleep modes. A master can command a slave to "park", and that slave will become inactive until the master tells it to wake back up.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

      <section id="Bluetooth_Profiles" class="main-section">
        <header>Bluetooth Profiles</header>
        <p>Bluetooth profiles are additional protocols that build upon the basic Bluetooth standard to more clearly define what kind of data a Bluetooth module is transmitting. While Bluetooth specifications define how the technology works, profiles define how it's used.</p>
        <p>The profile(s) a Bluetooth device supports determine(s) what application it's geared towards. A hands-free Bluetooth headset, for example, would use headset profile (HSP), while a Nintendo Wii Controller would implement the human interface device (HID) profile. For two Bluetooth devices to be compatible, they must support the same profiles.</p>
        <p>Let's take a look at a few of the more commonly-encountered Bluetooth profiles.</p>
        <h2>Serial Port Profile (SPP)</h2>
        <p>If you're replacing a serial communication interface (like RS-232 or a UART) with Bluetooth, SPP is the profile for you. SPP is great for sending bursts of data between two devices. It's is one of the more fundamental Bluetooth profiles (Bluetooth's original purpose was to replace RS-232 cables after all).</p>
        <div class="aside">
          <p>In telecommunications, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232">RS-232 or Recommended Standard 232</a> is a standard originally introduced in 1960[2] for serial communication transmission of data.</p>
          <p>Compared with later interfaces such as RS-422, RS-485 and Ethernet, RS-232 has lower transmission speed, shorter maximum cable length, larger voltage swing, larger standard connectors, no multipoint capability and limited multidrop capability. In modern personal computers, USB has displaced RS-232 from most of its peripheral interface roles. Thanks to their simplicity and past ubiquity, however, RS-232 interfaces are still usedâ€”particularly in industrial machines, networking equipment, and scientific instruments where a short-range, point-to-point, low-speed wired data connection is fully adequate.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Using SPP, each connected device can send and receive data just as if there were RX and TX lines connected between them. Two Arduinos, for example, could converse with each other from across rooms, instead of from across the desk.</p>
        <h2>Human Interface Device (HID)</h2>
        <p>HID is the go-to profile for Bluetooth-enabled user-input devices like mice, keyboards, and joysticks. It's also used for a lot of modern video game controllers, like WiiMotes or PS3 controllers.</p>
        <p>Bluetooth's HID profile is actually a riff on the HID profile already defined for human input USB devices. Just as SPP serves as a replacement for RS-232 cables, HID aims to replace USB cables (a much taller task!).</p>
        <h2>Hands-Free Profile (HFP) and Headset Profile (HSP)</h2>
        <p>Those Bluetooth earpieces that makes important business guys look like self-conversing wackos? Those usually use headset profile (HSP) or hands-free profile (HFP).</p>
        <p>HFP is used in the hands-free audio systems built into cars. It implements a few features on top of those in HSP to allow for common phone interactions (accepting/rejecting calls, hanging up, etc.) to occur while the phone remains in your pocket.</p>
        <h2>Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)</h2>
        <p>Advanced audio distribution profile (A2DP) defines how audio can be transmitted from one Bluetooth device to another. Where HFP and HSP send audio to and from both devices, A2DP is a one-way street, but the audio quality has the potential to be <i>much</i> higher. A2DP is well-suited to wireless audio transmissions between an MP3 player and a Bluetooth-enabled stereo.</p>
        <p>Most A2DP modules support a limited set of audio codecs. In the least they'll suport SBC (subband codec), they may also support MPEG-1, MPEG-2, AAC, and ATRAC.</p>
        <h2>A/V Remote Control Profile (AVRCP)</h2>
        <p>The audio/video remote control profile (AVRCP) allows for remote controlling of a Bluetooth device. It's usually implemented alongside A2DP to allow the remote speaker to tell the audio-sending device to fast-forward, rewind, etc.</p>
